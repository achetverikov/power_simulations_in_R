# Short tutorial for power analysis via simulations in R

This tutorial was initially run at the graduate school for Russian cognitive science students, TCTS GRAÐ”SCHOOL 2020 (https://osf.io/rshwm/), in St. Petersburg, Russia. The goal was to give a short intro into simulations with an emphasis on power simulations. There are examples for simple t-tests and ANOVAs and less simple hierarchical models as well as some practical exercises. Start with the simulations.Rmd or go to the compiled pdf or html files if you just want to see the results.
