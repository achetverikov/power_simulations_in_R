# Short tutorial for power analysis via simulations in R

This tutorial was initially run at the graduate school for Russian cognitive science students, TCTS GRAÐ”SCHOOL 2020 (https://osf.io/rshwm/), in St. Petersburg, Russia. The goal was to give a short intro into simulations with an emphasis on power simulations. There are examples for simple t-tests and ANOVAs and less simple within-subject ANOVAs as well as some practical exercises.
